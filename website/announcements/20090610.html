			  <p>Having written almost 25,000 lines of code since the start of our project, v6 was due for a code review. So that's what I did, reviewed the code with the help of a static code analysis tool (FxCop for you developers out there :) ) and fixed all sorts of inconsistencies in the code. This should result in slightly higher performance and better behaviour when Eraser is in use.</p>
			  <p>However, due to the same code changes resulting from the review, <strong>all tasks will be lost during the upgrade</strong>. You are encouraged to note down tasks which you intend to use in the new install and redefine them once it is installed. Furthermore, because quite a substantial amount of code has been rewritten, certain functions may no longer work (or they may not work properly.) Please report such bugs to <a href="../trac/newticket">Trac</a>!</p>
			  <p>Nonetheless, there has been a large number of bugs being fixed (as evidenced from the large jump in build number) and this release of Eraser should be better than before. Please help find any remaining bugs and report thme to Trac - this is most likely to be the final RC before Eraser 6 is released as stable. </p>

							Code Review/Cleanup with FxCop: User-visible changes:
							<ul>
								<li>Dialog boxes appear as right-to-left under Arabic or Hebrew locales (currently no impact since Eraser doesn't come in the Arabic or Hebrew translations; but this will be of importance once those translations are complete.)</li>
								<li>Remote Executor classes (eg Explorer context menu erasure, Eraser Command Line) rewritten from scratch - less prone to crashing and more reliable. This should fix problems for users who report that after selecting a file for erasure through the context menu nothing happens.</li>
								<li>Called IDispoable.Dispose on some disposable objects; should reduce memory consumption in the long run.</li>
								<li>The Eraser Tool Bar now is an ownerdrawn menu bar instead of a generic control. This allows for shortcuts to be used. Ctrl+N now maps to New Task.</li>
								<li>Native context menus look better. All context menus under Vista+ will be natively styled.</li>
								<li>More error messages are localisable, for it to be displayed in languages other than English (in non-English environments)</li>

							</ul>
							must be escaped by prepending a \ to it. This reduced ambiguity to the Eraser command line parser since , and = are used to denote subparameters.

				<h2>Why remove ISAAC?</h2>
				<p>Perhaps some of you are wondering why I'm removing ISAAC, the default PRNG for Eraser 5, from Eraser 6.</p>
				<p>I met up with <a href="http://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home/lingsan/">Professor Ling San</a> on a seminar he conducted and I managed to ask him about his opinion regarding ISAAC (through email). This was his response and I quote:</p>
				<blockquote>
					<p>After discussing with some colleagues who know ISAAC better, this is what some of them have to say:</p>
					<p>ISAAC cannot be considered as broken so far, despite the few properties highlighted in the works of Aumasson (the best attack to date) and Paul-Praneel (on a modified version rather than the original ISAAC).</p>
					<p>However, using ISAAC as a pseudo-random generator is maybe not an optimal choice, for</p>
					<ol>
						<li>the specification of ISAAC includes no precise initialization mechanism,</li>
						<li>ISAAC has probably not been as thoroughly analyzed as other algorithms,</li>
						<li>it uses a rather large internal state (more than 8192 bits), which may be a performance issue in certain environments.</li>
					</ol>
					<p>To use as a pseudo-random generator in cryptographic applications, we would suggest one of the stream ciphers selected by the eSTREAM project (http://www.ecrypt.eu.org/stream/), or AES in counter mode.</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>This, and in light of concerns that some members of the community have over the security of ISAAC (most notably <a href="../trac/ticket/143">#143</a>), I've come to a decision that ISAAC will be removed from Eraser. In addition, since an alternative was readily available in .NET (RNGCryptoServiceProvider) and that the default for v6 was set to the RNGCryptoServiceProvider, I felt that the change was not going to be really significant.</p>
				<h2>The On-Ramp</h2>
				<p>So you've still decided that v6 is for you? Look no further.</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Disclaimer: The code is still of <em>beta quality</em> and may not be as stable or secure as the released versions of Eraser.</strong>
					Internal testing has been conducted to a certain extent, but remember that this is beta quality code and any loss of information or any data left unerased due to the use of this software has been disclaimed.
				</p>
				<p>If you have read the disclaimer, read a few notes about <strong><a href="../trac/wiki/InstallingBetas">installing
							and using betas</a></strong> then download and runthe <strong><a href="../download.php?id=12">installer</a>.</strong> Some
							may have realised that the need for installing an Eraser Root Certificate
							is no longer needed - that is correct. I have managed to acquire a validated
							Certum Certificate which should validate without further action.</p>
