		/// Calling SetThreadExecutionState without ES_CONTINUOUS simply resets
		/// the idle timer; to keep the display or system in the working state,
		/// the thread must call SetThreadExecutionState periodically.
		/// 
		/// To run properly on a power-managed computer, applications such as fax
		/// servers, answering machines, backup agents, and network management
		/// applications must use both ES_SYSTEM_REQUIRED and ES_CONTINUOUS when
		/// they process events. Multimedia applications, such as video players
		/// and presentation applications, must use ES_DISPLAY_REQUIRED when they
		/// display video for long periods of time without user input. Applications
		/// such as word processors, spreadsheets, browsers, and games do not need
		/// to call SetThreadExecutionState.
		/// 
		/// The ES_AWAYMODE_REQUIRED value should be used only when absolutely
		/// necessary by media applications that require the system to perform
		/// background tasks such as recording television content or streaming media
		/// to other devices while the system appears to be sleeping. Applications
		/// that do not require critical background processing or that run on
		/// portable computers should not enable away mode because it prevents
		/// the system from conserving power by entering true sleep.
		/// 
		/// To enable away mode, an application uses both ES_AWAYMODE_REQUIRED and
		/// ES_CONTINUOUS; to disable away mode, an application calls
		/// SetThreadExecutionState with ES_CONTINUOUS and clears
		/// ES_AWAYMODE_REQUIRED. When away mode is enabled, any operation that
		/// would put the computer to sleep puts it in away mode instead. The computer
		/// appears to be sleeping while the system continues to perform tasks that
		/// do not require user input. Away mode does not affect the sleep idle
		/// timer; to prevent the system from entering sleep when the timer expires,
		/// an application must also set the ES_SYSTEM_REQUIRED value.
		/// 
		/// The SetThreadExecutionState function cannot be used to prevent the user
		/// from putting the computer to sleep. Applications should respect that
