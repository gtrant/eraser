		/// The WinVerifyTrust function performs a trust verification action on a
		/// specified object. The function passes the inquiry to a trust provider
		/// that supports the action identifier, if one exists.

		/// For certificate verification, use the CertGetCertificateChain and

		/// </summary>
		/// <param name="hWnd">Handle to a caller window. A trust provider can use
		/// this value to determine whether it can interact with the user. However,
		/// trust providers typically perform verification actions with input from
		/// the user.
		/// 
		/// This parameter can be one of the following values.
		/// Value					Meaning
		/// INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE	There is no interactive user. The trust provider
		///							performs the verification action without the
		///							user's assistance.
		///	Zero					The trust provider can use the interactive desktop
		///							to display its user interface.
		///	A valid window handle	A trust provider can treat any value other than
		///							INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE or zero as a valid window
		///							handle that it can use to interact with the user.</param>
		/// <param name="pgActionID">A pointer to a GUID structure that identifies an
		/// action and the trust provider that supports that action. This value indicates
		/// the type of verification action to be performed on the structure pointed to
		/// by pWinTrustData.
		/// 
		/// The WinTrust service is designed to work with trust providers implemented
		/// by third parties. Each trust provider provides its own unique set of action
		/// identifiers. For information about the action identifiers supported by a
		/// trust provider, see the documentation for that trust provider.
		/// 
		/// or example, Microsoft provides a Software Publisher Trust Provider that can
		/// establish the trustworthiness of software being downloaded from the Internet
		/// or some other public network. The Software Publisher Trust Provider supports
		/// the following action identifiers. These constants are defined in Softpub.h.</param>
		/// <param name="pWVTData">A pointer that, when cast as a WINTRUST_DATA structure,
		/// contains information that the trust provider needs to process the specified
		/// action identifier. Typically, the structure includes information that
		/// identifies the object that the trust provider must evaluate.
		/// 
		/// The format of the structure depends on the action identifier. For information
		/// about the data required for a specific action identifier, see the documentation
		/// for the trust provider that supports that action.</param>
		/// <returns>If the trust provider verifies that the subject is trusted for the
		/// specified action, the return value is zero. No other value besides zero
		/// should be considered a successful return.
		/// 
		/// If the trust provider does not verify that the subject is trusted for the
		/// specified action, the function returns a status code from the trust provider.
		/// 
		/// For example, a trust provider might indicate that the subject is not trusted,
		/// or is trusted but with limitations or warnings. The return value can be a
		/// trust-provider-specific value described in the documentation for an individual
		/// trust provider, or it can be one of the following error codes.
		/// 
		/// Return code						Description
		/// TRUST_E_SUBJECT_NOT_TRUSTED		The subject failed the specified verification
		///									action. Most trust providers return a more
		///									detailed error code that describes the reason
		///									for the failure.
		/// TRUST_E_PROVIDER_UNKNOWN		The trust provider is not recognized on this
		///									system.
		/// TRUST_E_ACTION_UNKNOWN			The trust provider does not support the
		///									specified action.
		/// TRUST_E_SUBJECT_FORM_UNKNOWN	The trust provider does not support the form
		///									specified for the subject.</returns>
